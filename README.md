## Introduction
This project investigates the **Medical Appointment No-Shows** dataset. The goal is to analyze the factors influencing patient attendance at medical appointments and derive meaningful insights from the data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains records of medical appointments in Brazil, aiming to address the question of why patients fail to attend their scheduled visits. It includes 14 features, such as:
- **PatientId**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **AppointmentID**: Unique identifier for each appointment.
- **Gender**: Patient's gender.
- **ScheduledDay**: The date when the appointment was scheduled.
- **AppointmentDay**: The date of the actual appointment.
- **No-show**: Indicates whether the patient attended ("No") or missed ("Yes") the appointment.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for execution and visualization)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the analysis step by step.
4. Interpret the results from the visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Project Structure
The analysis is divided into four main sections:
1. **Data Wrangling** - Loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualizing distributions and relationships in the dataset.
3. **Feature Analysis** - Examining key factors that influence no-shows.
4. **Conclusion** - Summarizing findings and possible recommendations.

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth look into patient behavior regarding medical appointments. By identifying key trends and patterns, healthcare providers can take proactive measures to reduce no-shows and improve patient engagement.
